# ROV Predictive Disturbance Rejection Playground

⌛⌛ Under Construction (but operational) ⌛⌛

* To be noted: this playground utilises CasADi as a solver within a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller. To avoid issues when running the NMPC launchpad, the version of the Windows CasADi package at the time of upload is included within this repository.
